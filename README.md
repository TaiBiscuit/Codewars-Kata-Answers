# Codewars Resolved Katas

A collection of katas that I've resolved from codewars.

I put my first submit, then a more optimized one once I revise it later.

Each kata is organized by its title, a copy of the description (or part of it) my answer and then a ''//OR'' comentary with the revised version below.
